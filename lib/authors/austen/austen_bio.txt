Her writing style is defined by realism and irony used to mock aspects of the British aristocracy that she found distasteful.  Most notably, she helped develop a style technique called "free indirect speech" in which the voice of the narrator is mixed with the characters, typically to lampoon the characters in the story for comic effect.
