Homer was a Greek epic poet who lived around the 8th century BCE. Litte is known of Homer, but he is beleieved to be the first epic poet.  His work dealt primarily with the lives of Heroes and the events surrounding the Trojan War. 

Using intentionally intricate verse, Homer sought to inflate the poetic beauty of his stories to render the primary characters as awe-inspiring, and their stories as extraordinary.  All of the traditions of epic poetry, and western literature, begin with Homer.
