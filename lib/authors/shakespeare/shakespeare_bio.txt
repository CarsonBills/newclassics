William Shakespeare was an English playwright born April 26, 1564 and died April 23, 1616.  He wrote thirty seven plays during his lifetime. His plays are often divided into Histories, Tragedies, and Comedies.

Shakespeare's stylized language followed many of the Elizabethan conventions of the day.  He primarily relied on elaborate metaphor and conceit to render emotions in language that was more lyrical and often humorous.
