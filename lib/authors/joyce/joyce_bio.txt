Joyce's writing often resists simple descriptions, as his greatest gift as a writer was his mastery of a myriad of different forms, be it journalistic headlines, or parodies of epic poetry.  He is best known for stream-of-conciousness narrative, in which the language reflects the unbroken process of thought, without traditional narrative pauses.
