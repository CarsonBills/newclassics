David Foster Wallace was an American writer born February 21, 1962 and died September 12, 2008.  Wallace published only two novels during his lifetime and several short stories. As a part of the American post-modern movement, much of his writing is written in a fractured manor to reflect his ideas about contemporary American culture. 

Wallace relies heavily on jargon and shifting narratives to render a multifaceted account of events. Along with his trademark footnotes, Wallace uses syntax that his occasionally invented alongside self-generated acronyms. Much of Wallace's writing attempts to reject irony as a toxic filter of experience in favour of unselfconscious experience.
