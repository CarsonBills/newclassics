Herman Melville was an American writer born August 1, 1819 and died September 28, 1891. Melville wrote several novels, and enjoyed some literary success with his early adventure novels, but attempted to write a more intense metaphysical work about the meaning of life that was widely criticized - Moby Dick.

Melville's style is defined by grandiose and complex sentences that employ a difficult syntax. Much of his writing uses this arduous style to make larger points about much heavy topics as the megalomania, the hostile universe, and of course... whales.
